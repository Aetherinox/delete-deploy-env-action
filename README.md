# delete-deployment-environment

GitHub action that will find and delete all deployments by deployment name as well as the GitHub environment
they are deployed to. It will first find and mark all deployments as `inactive` and then delete all deployments and then the environment.

- To only delete deployments and the not environment, add `onlyRemoveDeployments: true`.
- To keep deployments but inactivate all deployments, add `onlyDeactivateDeployments: true`
- To only delete a deployment ref and not all deployments of a given environment, add `ref: my-branch`

Note if you pass `onlyDeactivateDeployments: true` and `onlyRemoveDeployments: true`, `onlyRemoveDeployments` will override
`onlyDeactivateDeployments` and all deployments will be removed.

Also note that if you are planning on deleting a created environment, your `GITHUB_TOKEN` must have permissions with repo scope. The token provided by the workflow, `github.token` does not have the permissions to delete created environments. _(See [Delete an environment REST API docs](https://docs.github.com/en/rest/reference/repos#delete-an-environment))_

If you see a `Resource not accessible by integration` error, you'll likely need to follow the instructions below to obtain the proper token.

<br />

### Obtain A Token

For certain operations _(like deleting an environment)_, your GitHub Action will need additional permissions that your `github.token` simply doesn't have.

<br />

In this case, a [GitHub App](https://docs.github.com/en/developers/apps/getting-started-with-apps/about-apps) can be created to assume the required permissions, and ultimately your own Actions will use a [Private Key](https://docs.github.com/en/developers/apps/building-github-apps/authenticating-with-github-apps#generating-a-private-key) to later exchange for a JWT token, which this Action can use to execute operations.

<br />

1. [Create a GitHub app](https://docs.github.com/en/developers/apps/building-github-apps/creating-a-github-app).
2. [Generate a Private Key](https://docs.github.com/en/developers/apps/building-github-apps/authenticating-with-github-apps#generating-a-private-key)
3. Add your GitHub App's "App ID" to your repo's [Actions Secrets](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/security-guides/encrypted-secrets) _(ex: `GH_APP_ID`)_
4. Add your Private Key to your repo's [Actions Secrets](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/security-guides/encrypted-secrets) _(ex: `GH_APP_PRIVATE_KEY`)_
5. Use [navikt/github-app-token-generator](https://github.com/navikt/github-app-token-generator) before using this action to generate a JWT

   #### Example

   `cleanup-pr.yml`

   ```yml
   #
   # Cleans up a GitHub PR
   #
   name: üßº Clean up environment
   on:
   pull_request:
     types:
       - closed

   jobs:
     cleanup:
       runs-on: ubuntu-latest
       permissions: write-all

       steps:
         - uses: actions/checkout@v3

         # Points to a recent commit instead of `main` to avoid supply chain attacks. (The latest tag is very old.)
         - name: üéü Get GitHub App token
           uses: navikt/github-app-token-generator@a3831f44404199df32d8f39f7c0ad9bb8fa18b1c
           id: get-token
           with:
             app-id: ${{ secrets.GH_APP_ID }}
             private-key: ${{ secrets.GH_APP_PRIVATE_KEY }}

         - name: üóë Delete deployment environment
           uses: Aetherinox/delete-deploy-env-action@v2.2.3
           with:
             # Use a JWT created with your GitHub App's private key
             token: ${{ steps.get-token.outputs.token }}
             environment: pr-${{ github.event.number }}
             ref: ${{ github.ref_name }}
