#   @type               github workflow
#   @desc               when making your own Github workflow, you must create two new releases.
#                         1. the version released
#                         2. one with the 'latest' tag
#
#                       this allows a user to use your workflow in a github yml file using either the version tag
#                       or by using the latest tag.
#
#                       this workflow is triggered when you run the first workflow `release-publish.yml`.
#                       this workflow runs after the first workflow has completed releasing the version tag v3.x.x,
#                       and then this workflow will create a release with the tag 'latest' in your repo's 'Releases'
#                       page on Github

            #   when publishing a new release and tag, this workflow ensures that you always have
            #   a tag named @latest with the latest build of your application.
            #
            #   this is useful for projects like Github Workflows, because it allows a user to use
            #   your github workflow and specify the @latest tag at the end of the workflow path.
