#   @desc               grabs the latest version of your github release, and creates an additional tag called @latest
#                       useful for projects that involve creating github workflows that others can use.

            #   when publishing a new release and tag, this workflow ensures that you always have
            #   a tag named @latest with the latest build of your application.
            #
            #   this is useful for projects like Github Workflows, because it allows a user to use
            #   your github workflow and specify the @latest tag at the end of the workflow path.
